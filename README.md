Hi, I’m @TrechNex. 👋

After graduating with a Computer Science degree in 2013, I acquired five years' experience building cloud middleware 
microservices, using Java, C# and Python for large organizations.

Since 2018, I have been writing technical documentation for Oracle Linux, Oracle Cloud, and related technologies. 
I currently use this personal account to interact with my employer's projects.

All views are my own and not necessarily those of my employer. 
No suggestions, instructions or code posted by me on any online platform are supported by my employer unless explicitly stated
on [docs.oracle.com](https://docs.oracle.com).

I have previously published articles in [Linux Format](https://web.archive.org/web/20250209023243/https://linuxformat.com/archives?author_find=87) magazine, and on my
previous GitHub account I worked on a number of libre software side-projects, most notably the "Glimpse" fork of the 
GNU Image Manipulation Program. Archived (read-only) backups of those projects are now hosted on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/TrechNex).

You can review my prior work experience in the technology industry and current certifications on 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trechnex/).
