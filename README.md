Hi, Iâ€™m @TrechNex. ðŸ‘‹

I mostly use this personal account for work purposes. I only host my own projects in private repositories. 

- :briefcase: How to connect with me professionally: https://www.linkedin.com/in/trechnex/
- :mailbox: How to reach my personal (non-work) accounts: https://keybase.io/trechnex

I am no longer involved with the [Glimpse](https://github.com/glimpse-editor) project. 
Direct questions about that software to active contributors using their provided [contact links](https://glimpse-editor.org/contribute/).

All views are my own and not necessarily those of my employer. 
No suggestions or instructions posted by me are supported by my employer unless explicitly stated on [docs.oracle.com](https://docs.oracle.com).
